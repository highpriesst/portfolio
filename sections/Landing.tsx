            with a passion for creating visually appealing and user-friendly
            websites and applications. My interest in web development started
            back in 2012 when I decided to try editing custom Tumblr themes â€”
            turns out hacking together a custom reblog button taught me a lot
            about HTML &amp; CSS! With a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and
            JavaScript, and also React/Typescript.I bring ideas to life through
            clean and efficient code. I have a keen eye for design and am always
            striving to stay up-to-date on the latest web development trends and
            techniques. I am dedicated to delivering high-quality work and am
            committed to exceeding client expectations. Thank you for
            considering me for your front-end development needs. I am excited to
            work with you and bring your ideas to life.

          <ul className="flex">
            {skills &&
              skills.map((skill, i) => (
                <li key={i} className="relative mb-5 pl-10 font-mono text-xs">
                  {skill}
                </li>
              ))}
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
