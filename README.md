Personal Portfolio website

Technologies to use: 
  NextJS for FE and BE together
  Express if needed? 
  MongoDB? PostgreSQL GraphQL with Prisma? Pick carefully!

  Build it responsive, mobile first technique! Bootstrap, tailwind? Pick the easiest one

  Divide the project to two(2) client-side and server-side, deal with them seperatly

  Use Typescript instead Javascript for frontend, maybe even for the express/NodeJS

  Can GO and Python is considered for smaller porfolio project.

  Consider 1 small but effective project with ReactNative if possible!.
